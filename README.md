# Comp2048-Assignment-Andreas1141007-v2

Due to overwhelming errors in the frist version of my program this is a remade version of my program.  Click the link here, https://github.com/ALentini222/Comp2048-Assignment-Andreas1141007.git , to see the original.  

This application will eventualy display reviews and playtime for video games --> the data to put into the database was from the IGN top 100 video games of all time https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-games

There will eventually be a reviewing system built into the website so shortly the data will not be the same as what is on ign it was just a starting point for the data.
